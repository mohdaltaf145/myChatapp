// Iâ€™ll try my best to explain this. Generally speaking:
// GET requests are for when just want to retrieve a page. (get the contents of a page)
// POST requests are for transferring data.
//When you submit your password to a website or upload an image to a website, you are using a POST request.
// When you set app.post for a route, you are telling the code that the route in question can only accept POST requests.
